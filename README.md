# SqlQueryBuilder

SQL Query Crafter for MySQL/MariaDB

## History

I no longer remember how many times I had to hand-craft and optimize a query for a particular case
in various PHP projects. In order to perform the aforementioned optimizations, I had to resort to bad practices,
ugly code and extreme string manipulation. Until I said _no more_.
